# Runnr.ai integration developer assessment
This repository contains working Django code. Run your code locally, you don't need any external services.

## Prerequisites:
- use Python version 3.11
- install dependencies by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Run server
`python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`

## Relevant information
- The file `views.py` contains a webhook endpoint to receive updates from the PMS. These updates don't contain any details of the actual reservations. They require you to fetch additional details of any reservation.
- The file `external_api.py` mocks API calls that are available to you to get additional guest and reservation details. Note that the API calls sometimes generate errors, or invalid data. You should deal with those in the way you see fit.
- The file `pms_systems.py` contains an AbstractBaseClass and a ChildClass of a `PMS`. You will find explanations of what all the methods do inside the methods of the ABC.
- The file `models.py` contains your database models. The models should be mostly self-explanatory. Relations are defined and some columns have `help_text`.

## TODO
- Fork the repo into your own Github account. Make the fork public.
- Implement the following methods for the child class `PMS_Mews` in the file `pms_systems.py`: `clean_webhook_payload`, `handle_webhook`, `update_tomorrows_stays`, `stay_has_breakfast`.
- Webhook calls should use the `clean_webhook_payload`, `handle_webhook` methods. You should test the webhook functionality by making Postman POST request to the url: `http://localhost:8000/webhook/mews/` with the payload:

            "Name": "ReservationUpdated",
            "Value": {
                "ReservationId": "5a9469b7-f13f-4a8d-b092-afe400fd7721"
            }
        },
        {
            "Name": "ReservationUpdated",
            "Value": {
                "ReservationId": "7c22cb23-c517-48f9-a5d4-da811043bd67"
            }
        },
        {
            "Name": "ReservationUpdated",
            "Value": {
                "ReservationId": "7c22cb23-c517-48f9-a5d4-da811023bd67"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
- imagine that the method `update_tomorrows_stays` runs every day in the evening to update the stays that will checkin tomorrow. You should test this by running a Django shell and calling the method manually. `python manage.py shell`
- The last method `stay_has_breakfast` can be called from anywhere in the code. It should return the correct value.
